         *  An object represents an entity that has both behaviors and data
         *  This forms encapsulation
         *  Three primary principles of OOP:
         *      Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
         *
         *  In this section, we will focus mainly on Encapsulation:
         *      Bundles fields and methods in objects, which are made from classes.
         *      UML class diagrams help us understand the design of a class.
