************************* Section 3 - Abstraction ***************************

 Abstraction:
  -Something that exists in theory, but does not have a concrete existence
  -Is not designed to be instantiated
  -Are implemented by their subclasses
  -Abstract methods have not body, only signature is defined (not designed to be run as is)
  -Designed to be overwritten by a subclass
  -Think of it as a standard template
  -Excellent for setting standards for implementations of related concepts

  Key Points:
   -Abstract classes and methods are templates that are meant to be implemented by their subclasses
   -Classes and methods are declared abstract by using the abstract reserved work
   -If a subclass inherits from an abstract class, it must implement its abstract methods or the class itself must be declared as abstract
   -Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, only to be used as a superclass
