************************* Section 5 - Data Structures ***************************

 Collections:
  -Data structures that hold a group of objects

 Elements within a Collection:
  -Unique vs duplication
  -Ordered vs unordered

 Java provides a collections framework which consists of interfaces, classes, and methods to store and manipulate these group of objects.
 All of the interfaces and classes of the collections framework can be found in the java.utils package.
 Collection itself is an interface and is the root of the hierarchy.

 Most common are Set, List, Queue, and Map

 Set:
  -Collection of unique unordered elements

 List:
  -Collection of ordered elements that can be accessed by position. Can contain duplicates.

 Queue:
  -Collection of ordered elements that are processed in the order they are added
  FIFO (First In First Out)

 Map:
  -Collection of unordered unique key-value pairs

 java.util.Collections
  -A class that contains algorithms for working with collections

  Ex. binarySearch, copy, frequency, reverse, shuffle, sort

 Iterator works on Sets, List, and Queues bc they inherit from the collections interface. Does not work on Map. Have to use entry set.
