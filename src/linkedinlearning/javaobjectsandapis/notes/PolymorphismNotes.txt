************************* Section 2 - Polymorphism ***************************

 Polymorphism:
  -The ability to take multiple forms

 Type vs Instance:
  -An object can have a superclass type and a subclass instance

 Overridden Methods:
  -If a method is overridden by the subclass, the polymorphic object will execute the overridden method at runtime
