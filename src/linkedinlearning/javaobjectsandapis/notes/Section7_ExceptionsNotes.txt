************************* Section 7 - Exceptions ***************************

 -Try/Catch used to handle exceptions
 -Stack Trace: An interactive log of method calls that led to a thrown exception

 Two Categories of Exceptions:
  -Checked: Exceptions that are verified by the compiler before the code is executed. Must be declared in the method's signature.
  -Unchecked: Exceptions that are not verified by the compiler. Runtime exception and all of its subclasses are considered unchecked exceptions.
              Can also choose to catch unhandled exceptions if you choose but not required.

 Multiple Exceptions:
  -Polymorphism (i.e. use Exception e instead of IOException e if you don't know what errors it will throw)
  -A series of catch block
  -A single catch block that catches multiple exceptions

 Finally:
  -When an exception is thrown, files are not properly closed. A finally block is useful for executing code that ALWAYS will be run no matter what.

 Try with resources:
  -Allows you to automatically close resources after the execution of a try block
  -Only works with closeable/autoclosable interfaces (i.e. scanner/printwriter)
